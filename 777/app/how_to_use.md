# How to use?

SpellBook works best when used as an interactive journal, an idea incubator, or longterm brainstorm-list. So next time when presented with the urge to open Social Media, try opening SpellBook! Go through your ideas, add a few new ones, and make sure to add 'completed' ideas as Earth!

## 🜁🜂 The Four Feeds 🜄🜃

As you've learned, things are categorized into one of the four elements. Each tab gives you one of the four possible looks at your SpellBook. The story section is not affected by the tab theme.

You can adjust the chosen words for each tab in the settings. They serve as a reminder as to what each feed shows.

The key is to learn to categorize all experience into the same overarching structure. In SpellBook we encourage using four categories. There's a reason for this, but out of scope to explain right here.

- 🜁 Do you want to review ideas or get a sense of 'space', open the air tab.
- 🜂 Do you feel you need more passion or review decisions, open the fire tab.
- 🜄 Is there something you're going through, review the water tab. Maybe some of those things will help you!
- 🜃 Do you want to feel calm, review what you've done, or reference delivered work, check out the Earth tab.

## ⚡️ The Lightning Button

The lightning strike button acts like a 'like' button and it charges your thing or element.

Striking the lightning tells SpellBook 'I want to put more attention on this'. When you see an idea that you like, THEN CHARGE IT! It will make the thing appear more often in your feeds, and thus increasing your attention on what's important. Things that have 1 or moore charges are turned into stories for quick review and iteration.

You can charge things one time per day, adding one '+1' charge. The total charge of each thing decays (goes down) by 50% each 7 days. A thing with 2.0 charges will have 1.0 charge next week, 0.5 one week later, and 0.25 two weeks later, until it hits zero one day Charges decay to simulate natural decay of radiant material. So keep hot ideas hot, and leave non-exciting ideas behind.

## 🔥  Stories

Charged things are turned into stories, for quick access and deeper introspection, perhaps even making you jump into action.

Go through your stories daliy, and honestly analyse if you want to further pursue some action, or actively work on it in real life.

Stories also allow you to stay updated on your MOST IMPORTANT ideas. Keep on charging ideas which you Love.

## 🔆 More tips on using the elements?

The four elements are "ways of looking at the world".
It may look tough sometime to guess into which category to put a created 'thing'. It's therefore easier to analyse your intention-context:

- DataAre you being airy or have a vague idea (air)?
- Are you passionate and committed (fire)?
- Do you try to move forward but something is blocking you (water)?
- Did you read something someone wrote (earth)?
- Did you finished something as part of the journey (earth)?

All the above suggests to monitor where you intentions lie.
Am I describing an idea? Am I making a decision? Am I expressing a difficult passage? Am I finalizing a statement?
				
Remember that you can learn to 'put on' lenses whenever you need it.
- 🜁 Need to feel free?{'\n'}Look at the world airy!
- 🜂 Need more commitment?{'\n'}Look at the world with Love!
- 🜄 Need to feel understood?{'\n'}Allow the water to pour down!
- 🜃 Need to feel stable?{'\n'}Consider it all been done.

## 🍪 Use Collections!

Whenever you're starting a new project, start a new collection!

Say you're into "Passive income", but you're still trying out different ideas, thus create a collection "Passive Income", and add all new content to that collection! Using collections helps you order your mind space into seperate "attention points". These are the 'working themes' of your current journey.

## ∞   Symbols & Meaning

Symbols are light on a screen, to which many things can be attributed to. The M in McDo shops has more meaning to us than just 'hamburgers and fries'. The four elements are thus only four words with a particular profound meaning. SpellBook uses a PRACTICAL application to these, but it's important to stay playful. Create your own versions across the four elements, and see where they will bring you!
				
## ✅ Avatars? Sigils? QR/MR Codes? New Age?

To make your ideas appealing and unique, we created a visual hash algorithm, based on ancient sigil making techniques. The algorithm takes the title of your thing, and follows a path through letters which are mounted on a circle. The path through the letters is colored in the chosen element of the concept. It's believed that similarly spelled titles will look more familiar. This then encourages a deeper interaction with your ideas. It also acts like a visual anchor point, bringing created things onto a deeper layer of cognition. There's a case for this being a gimmick, but then again, anything analyses deeply enough removes the journey through it.

## 👀 Feed Modes

Each presented feed has a small dropdown button, allowing you to select a feed mode. Feed modes configure the algorithm responsible for showing us our own content back to us. Some feed modes will be based on charges, others on randomness. Some on modified date, and others on activity level.

Feed mode also allows you to filter things based on time. This way you can stay focused on say... only the ideas that have been active for the last 88 days (one mercury cycle).

## 🦉 General Philosophy
In SpellBook you get to spell out the THINGS that are on your mind. These can be ideas, problems, solutions, or results. Or maybe combinations thereof (that's a the secret!).

Many people have many perspectives in this world, so each perspective should be described by a common classification habit, allowing for common communication, at an intuition level.

If this all may seem too much, remember this: SpellBook is a river for ideas. Scroll through your content, engage with what you like, add charges to ideas that are of particular importance, and discard the rest!
