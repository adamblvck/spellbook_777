## 1.3.0* Planets and Stability (12 Aug 2022)

Over the past few months SpellBook has received many requests. Some of these requests have been fixed and implemneted today, while others require more assessment to ensure a top-notch data privacy guarantee. Below a list of all changes in this release, which is meant to fix *most* reported bugs out there!

- Added `planets`, which acts as an extra category for your things. To enable planets, go to `settings > planets > enable`. Planets can be accessed/added both in things and in subthings.
- Redesigned MR-code preview screen, aiming to add AI-capabilities soon!
- Custom font sizes, now available in the settings page!
- Added a contextual 777 reference library, unlocking in September for everyone!
- The 777 library contains both a tree-of-life and a 4x4 matrix analysis
- Fixed navigation issues, save issues, weird crashes (especially on Android)
- Updated to latest SDK for more smoothness and security
