## 1.1.0 Subthing Deletion, MR-Codes and Performance Update (23 Feb 2022)
This update features tons of small little UX and data hiccups which will make SpellBook an app you can trust. Two months in development, this update includes:
- Overall app performance increase (all things data and privacy)!
- You can now delete subtings from things (this prunes all subthings below it too).
- You can change the element from subthings.
- Added loading indicators when data is loading or processing.
- Improved readability of 'light' mode.
- Added MR-code 'explanation' section (beneath each sigil).
- Added foreign alphabets to MR-code.
- Fixed deletion errors on things and groups (bugs).
- Fixed weird MR-code rotation (bug).
- Fixed images not correctly resizing.
