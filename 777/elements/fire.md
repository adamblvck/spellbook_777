# The Element of Fire

In this thing, a list of references and hints, partaining to the meaning of the element of Fire.

## High Level Meanings

Fire usually represents the second step of conscious action in the world, and its basic meaning is represented by the following words:
- Decisions

More philosphical meanings of Fire are:

**Do not** try to read all the above and remember them on your first day. It's far more beneficial to scan through them when at blank when working with SpellBook, then pick what fits for your situation. Any written description of Air falls short of the process of noticing the element in action, and accessing its category consciously and intuitively.

**Most usefully** would be coming up with your own language constructs for the four elements.

## Symbolic Representation

Symbolized globally across all nations and religions by an upward triangle, the symbol has three corners, with one pointing upwards.

The top corner is pointing up, which suggests expansion and the "the going up of energy", much like when physical fire is burning. The top corner also stands "higher" than the lower two corners, which forms what we understand as a hierarchy. In a hierarchy, some things are more important than others, and it's so purely by Will, or human projection.

Further, consider how focusing a light bundle onto one tiny spot, increases the amount of energy which arrives there. Same happens with consciousness and decisions. To be spread thinly, means that your energy or "focus" is scattered. Thus when saying YES to ONE THING, you say no to ALL OTHER THINGS. This both causes an increase of focus, more passion and power into a chosen direction, and a thus things start moving, and expanding.

Considering how much things there are in life, like potential partners, possible jobs, books to read, apps to download, content to create or consume, etc ... By cheer vastness of possiblity, one has to **choose**. But what to choose? Ah well, choose that which you Love! Thus Fire is often attributed to **Love** and **Passions**.
