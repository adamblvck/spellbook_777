# The Element of Water

In this thing, a list of references and hints, partaining to the meaning of the element of Water.

## High Level Meanings

Water usually represents the third step of conscious action in the world, and its basic meaning is represented by:
- Emotions
- Feeling the moment
- Work
- Acceptance
- Receiving
- Processing
- Visualiziion
- Storytelling & Communication

More philosphical meanings of Water include:
- The ability to act as a receiving dish for decisions
- To process and sit confidently in emotional currents
- Adaptability and elasticity in one's approach to life
- To binding of multiple perspectives and observations into a a few sentences
- Wisdom after lived experience
- The aftermath after water's insights
- The notion of "pastness", as opposite to Fire's Futureness.

**Do not** try to read all the above and remember them on your first day. It's far more beneficial to scan through them when at blank when working with SpellBook, then pick what fits for your situation. Any written description of Air falls short of the process of noticing the element in action, and accessing its category consciously and intuitively.

**Most usefully** would be coming up with your own language constructs for the four elements.

## Symbolic Representation

Water is usually symbolised by whirles which go across the bottom of a container. Another popular symbol is the downwards pointing triangle, or the cup. The moon (or luna symbol) with its concave side up also fits in this imagery.

When considering whirls or 'ripples' across the bottom of a container, it symbolises the ability of water to require both to be accepted by a container, aswell as the complete adaptability of the Water's "shape" to the container. Water's qualities in our conscious aspects are thus like that.

The downward pointing triangle suggests the reverse process of Fire. Where Fire caused expansion, Water is about cooling down. What comes up, must come down, and hence the universe balances out that which isn't balanced. The "pointing down" symbolism is very peculiar, as it seems like emotions and feelings are received by the body as we allow to feel them.
