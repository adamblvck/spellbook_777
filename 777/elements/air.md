# The Element of Air

In this thing, a list of references and hints, partaining to the meaning of the element of Air.

## High Level Meanings

Air usually represents the first step of conscious action in the world, and its basic meaning is represented by the following words:
- Ideas
- Thinking and Thought
- Mental aspects
- Possibilities
- Insights
- Context

More philosphical meanings of Air are:
- The process of understanding into refined 
- Available knowledge without extra learning (learning is Water)
- Movement and the room for movement
- Analysis of any kinds
- Maximal description of something
- The notion of "nowness", in contrast with Fire's futureness, or Water's Pastness.

**Do not** try to read all the above and remember them on your first day. It's far more beneficial to scan through them when at blank when working with SpellBook, then pick what fits for your situation. Any written description of Air falls short of the process of noticing the element in action, and accessing its category consciously and intuitively.

**Most usefully** would be coming up with your own language constructs for the four elements.

## Symbolic Representation

Air is often represented as a circle, or sphere. Other representations include whirls (like in wind whirls), galaxy-like swirly figures, and in the hermetic tradition: a crossed-through upward triangle (üúÅ).

When symbolized by a circle or a sphere, the symbol lacks any corners and thus is allowed to roll freely, and bounce around effortlessly. Consider thus how also our ability to **think**, or to **consider between options**. Perhaps more commonly, to be able to **discern and create ideas and concepts** given room to think, is all a quality of air, or the first step.

It helps to consider that one's life is strongly determined by one's **circle of availability**. See this as the gathered ideas and concepts of the world around you, which give you a representation of "what to do next in your life". This circle gives you room to move around and abound safely, and thus the analysis of this space can be considered an aspect of air.

Right at the boundary of this circle sits the edge of our comfort. Within the circle we have conquered domain, and it's considered to be thoroughly visited from our first steps, to our greatest efforts. Outside this circle lies our discomfort, the unknown, and adventure. Through the other elements (like Fire or Water) we can go beyond our circle of comfort, and thus grow, learn, and expand. The other three elements are thus directy linked to Air by their interconnected nature.

Swirly symbolism shares many aspects of the circle representation, including that of hydrodynamic movement of physical air or water through space, by assumption that the particles are "dots" or "little balls" which are free to bounce around, and exchange energy by unaltered interaction.

The crossed-through upward triangle (üúÅ) symbol has to be interpreted in conjunction with Fire (the upward triangle). Considering that all there is "up" or "down", going "beyond up" is like "considering all things that can be up", which is the crossed upward triangle. Air is thus the space "beyond the confines of decisions", which is in perfect alignment with the notion of possibilities and room for movement.

## Nuances when considering Air

To have ideas about something, or to attempt to understand something, usually suggests the composed thing to belong to the category of Air.

There are nuances however, to mention a few:
- A todo-list is Air (as it gives room for possibilities), whereas the decision to execute on a single todo-item in a list is Fire.
- When one is feeling emotional when working with ideas, concepts or options: try describing the thing as Air, then add Water as a subthing ('comment') to phrase your emotional state, further unwinding chaotic states of thought.
- **Questions are not Air, they are Fire**, that's because questions have a tendency to "filter one's attention into answering them" and thus causing passion when answering them. The answer to a question (fire) can be all other categories, including fire itself. Answer fire to fire causes very interesting experiences when using SpellBook.
- When reading a quote which inspired an idea, just state the idea as Air, then add Earth crediting the quote or person who said something. To know your sources is potentially the most vital exercise when doing inner exploration.
- When reading or hearing an idea by someone else, and you like the idea very much as your own, you can either proceed as in the previous point, or add it as Earth (stating the quote / idea as said by XYZ, or written in ABC), then adding an Air subthing with your own twist and context to it.

The air element gets even more nuanced when considering planetary categories:
- When the Air aspect interferes with your sense of luxury and your ability to enjoy and love life, it belongs to the category of Venus, and thus should be debugged in the green color. Either make the step towards planetary initiation (that is, using a 4x4 meaning matrix, as opposed to a 1x4 meaaning matrix), or try untangling your concept into multiple subthings.
- When the process of understanding comes with a deep sense of impacting the future - which includes "being correct in the future" - it belongs to category of Mercury. Scientific inquiry, business plans, merchanize, and discernment across facts as they relate to daily life are 

## Esoteric Discernment

In the complete analysis of the four elements, three primary non-physical cycles are represented:

- In the imaginary cycle, air represents the first step, and thus the concept of range of possibilies, and the concept of useful knowledge in context of one's immediate environment.
- In the kernel cycle, air represents the second step, and thus the concept of acceptance and contemplation of whatever is. It's the use of the mind to inquire into what has been received, and build furhter tracks-for-thought, to go within.
- In the real cycle, air represents the third step, and thus concept of clarity and space, after thorough acts of will and courage have been displayed.

The three cycles are held together by the four (macroscopic and non-cyclic) thermodynamic potentials, which are physical in nature:
- **U (Internal Energy)** = Energy needed to create a system
- **F (Helmholtz Free Energy)** = Energy needed to create a system, without the energy around the system
- **H (Enthalpy)** = Energy needed to create a system, and to make room for it
- **G (Gibbs Free Energy)** = Energy needed to create a system, make room for it, without any energy surrounding it
