# The Element of Earth

In this thing, a list of references and hints, partaining to the meaning of the element of Earth.

## High Level Meanings

Earth usually represents the fourth and last step of conscious action in the world, and its basic meaning is represented by the following words:
- Results
- Habits
- Measurements
- Outcomes
- Rigidity & Inertia
- Being the same for a long-time
- Evidence: recorded past, yet experienced in the present

More philosphical meanings of Fire are:
- Squaring the circle
- Data which can be fitted into a table or spreadsheet
- Collapsing the wavefunction
- Building something that will last for a long time, like buildings
- The process of data gathering is Earth-like
- Inert and robust things, references, or actions which "keep on giving"

**Do not** try to read all the above and remember them on your first day. It's far more beneficial to scan through them when at blank when working with SpellBook, then pick what fits for your situation. Any written description of Air falls short of the process of noticing the element in action, and accessing its category consciously and intuitively.

**Most usefully** would be coming up with your own language constructs for the four elements.

## Symbolic Representation

Symbolized widely as either a small globe, the square, the cube, and the crossed downward pointing triangle (ðŸœƒ).

When represnted by the crossed downward pointing triangle, we're speaking of the symbol of water which "stopped moving" and "got stuck in an outer frame". Symbolically, the cooling down process of Water crystallized, and became part of an everlasting environment contribution.

Consider how most buildings, doors, books, data points, and even physical measurements are either SQUARE or enjoy rectangular corners. Something about squaring and creating 90 degree corners creates a certain robustness and long lastingness.

Such is also the case for water - all things that are learned, visited, seen, or observed through the physical eye, ear, touch or taste, belong to primary element of Earth.
